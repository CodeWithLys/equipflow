## üöÄ Overview

This project was developed for **TechInnovators Inc.** (fictional) to address the challenge of managing a growing inventory of engineering equipment.  
The solution combines an **Oracle APEX portal** for administrators with a **Python client** for employees, ensuring a seamless and efficient workflow.

**Problem Solved:** Inefficient manual tracking, misplaced equipment, and lack of visibility into usage trends.

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Backend & Admin Portal:** Oracle APEX 22.2, ORDS, Oracle Database 21c, PL/SQL  
- **Employee Client:** Python 3.9+, Tkinter  
- **API Communication:** REST APIs (`requests`)  
- **QR Codes:** `qrcode`, `opencv-python`, `pillow`  
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## üèó System Architecture

The system uses a **3-tier architecture**:

1. **Presentation Layer:**  
   - Oracle APEX (Admin Portal)  
   - Python Tkinter (Employee Client)  

2. **Application Layer:**  
   - ORDS (REST APIs)  
   - PL/SQL business logic  

3. **Data Layer:**  
   - Oracle Database 21c

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Oracle Database 21c+  
- Oracle APEX 22.2+  
- Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS)  
- Python 3.9+  

### 1. Database & APEX Setup
1. Run SQL scripts in `database-scripts/` to create schema and seed data.  
2. Import `apex-application/techinnovators_app.sql` into your APEX workspace.  
3. Configure ORDS for REST access.  

### 2. Python Client Setup
```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/techinnovators-inventory-system.git
cd techinnovators-inventory-system/python-client

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure API in config.py
BASE_URL = "https://your-apex-instance/ords/techinnovators/"

# Run client
python main.py
